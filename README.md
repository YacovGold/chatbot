The aim of the project is to help novice developers enter the job market.
Taking a beginner programmer costs a company a lot of investment and money until the developer can manage on his own, therefore, most companies will try to take developers with experience only. Even if it is basic experience, it changes the whole picture.

The goal of the project is to take novice developers, teach them the basics (how to work in a team, git, pull-request, code-review, etc.), so that when the person looks for a job, it will be much easier for him / her to integrate as a junior developer.

The project contains code from several juniors (and me :smile:).
